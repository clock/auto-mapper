# OUTDATED
lunar has since changed their system and this is no longer needed.
side not this was never supposed to be a public repo, so the code is uncommented and messy (also really poorly optimized).

# auto-mapper
automatically makes updated mappings for lunar client.


all you have to do is toss a mc dump and lunar-prod-optifine.jar into the input folder

TODO:
dump parameters for methods (dont really have to do that yet)
